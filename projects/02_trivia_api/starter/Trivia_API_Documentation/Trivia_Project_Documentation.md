# The Trivia Game

This project is a game. Users of this application will be able to find a list of questions and their answers, search for questions based on their category (e.g. Science), add and delete questions. They will also be able to play a game where random questions are displayed depending on category and they have to answer them.

All backend code within this project follows PEP8 style guidelines.


## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development
Developers should have python or python3, node and pip installed on their local machines.

### Backend

For the backend, navigate to the backend folder and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. All packages are included in the requirements file.

### Setting up the Database

With your Postgres server running, in your terminal, run the following commands:
```
createdb trivia
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

To run the application, navigate to the project directory and enter the following commands in your terminal:
```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
python -m flask run --reload
```

These commands put the application into development and direct the application to the ```__init__.py``` file in the flaskr directory. They will also open a debugger in your terminal which will reload every time changes are made to the application. The application will be run on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

### Frontend

To begin the frontend server, navigate to the frontend folder. If you have not already done so, run ```npm install//```. After doing this, you can run ```npm start``` to start the frontend server.


### Tests

To run tests, navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands in your terminal:
```
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
